# Counter MVC using Euca

This is a basic counter MVC app I use as a smoke test for Euca.
using `euca::Dom` for DOM generation and a version using `typed-html`.

## Building and Running

Run the following commands to serve this example using live-server. Any
modifications to the app will be detected, causing the app to automatically
rebuild and reload.

This depends on the [`fd`] and [`entr`] utilities.

```
npm install
script/watch
```
